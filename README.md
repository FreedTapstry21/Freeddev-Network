# Welcome
Hey there! Nice to see you here!
So you want to learn about Freeddev hm? Well let me help you out a bit!

## Requirements
To do anything with the code, you will need some stuff to start off with.
- A computer running Linux or MacOS (Windows is currently not officially supported)
- Have Git, Node.js and npm installed

## Set up your own server
Too start setting up your server begin with opening your terminal (command prompt) and cloning the repository.
To do that type `git clone https://github.com/FreedTapstry21/Freeddev-Network` into your terminal window.
Then go inside the newly created folder by typing `cd Freeddev-Network`

Now you will need to install the dependesies, else the server won't run!

To install the dependesies type `npm install`
Now lastly, to run the server type `npm start`

This will start the server and voila, Freeddev server is now running!
If you're having trubble starting the server I recommend you try running the server as root (Administrator on Windows).

## Look at the code yourself
Looks like someone here wants to look at code.
First we will need to open a terminal window (command prompt) and have git installed.

To clone the repository type `git clone https://github.com/FreedTapstry21/Freeddev-Network` into your terminal window.
Then open the folder by typing `cd Freeddev-Network`

And there you go! All the code is in your hands!

## But at what cost?
Nothing! Freeddev is free! (Apart from your electric bill)
You can redestribute, modify and use Freeddev as you want.
Tho there are some things that you need to keep in mind.
As a single developer, I would like for you to follow the MIT licence to make sure that my work can be reconized by others.
